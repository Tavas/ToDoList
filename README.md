# ToDoList
A simple JavaScript ToDoList App

This animated responsive web app performs functions such as 'add task', has a popover 'how to' button, and after adding the first task shows a 'delete' button next to each task, an additional 'delete all' button for deleting the whole list, and on click 'line-through' to mark a finished task.
